## Preliminary list of hack projects

In no particular order:

1. Mapping ground signal
1. Cross-talk
1. Planet and/or point source simulations
1. Long term noise fluctuations
1. Long term gain fluctuations
1. Quick coverage maps from TOAST ground schedules
1. Data I/O (i.e. support your favorite data format)
1. Convolve/deconvolve a transfer function
1. Fixed elevation steps in the scheduler
1. Gap length proportional to patch separation in scheduler
1. Bore sight rotation
1. HWP demodulation and downsampling
1. Add your own
